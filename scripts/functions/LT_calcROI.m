function [ROIsHbo, badROI] = LT_calcROI(hbo, badChannels)
    
    %this function averages hbo time series by channel into hbo time series averaged by ROIs for the study Laughing Together
	%averages are only calculated if the ROI has at least two good channels. Otherwise, the resulting ROI contains NaNs
	%If the ROI has less than two good channels, its index gets included in the variable "badROI" so it can be excluded for future steps
	%ROIs are: IFGr (channels 9 to 12), IFGl (channels 5 to 8), TPJr (channels 13 to 16) and TPJl (channels 1 to 4)
    
    %hbo: cell containing oxygenated hemoglobin time series
    %badChannels: lists of bad channels
    
    %Output: 
    % ROIsHbo: cell with one time series for each ROI
    % badROI: list of ROIs which had less than two good channels
